# 🐔 Chicken Records CLI Application

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a **work-in-progress Proof of Concept (PoC)** application being developed for a local Chicken Breeder. The goal is to help them transition from a paper-based system to a local, digital database to manage their chicken records more efficiently.

Over the next **4 weeks**, this application will evolve from a simple CLI-based menu system into a more functional record-keeping solution. The initial version will store chicken data in a basic in-memory list, with future enhancements including optional CSV/text file storage.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To build a **command-line interface (CLI)** that allows the user to:

```

Menu:
0 - Exit App
1 - Print List of Chicken Records
2 - Create New Chicken Record
3 - Update Existing Chicken Record
4 - Delete a Chicken Record

````

## ✅ Current Functionality (Week 1–2)

- [x] Print to screen  
- [ ] Clear the screen  
- [x] Accept user input  
- [x] Store chicken names in a Python list  

> **Example Chicken Names** used for demonstration:  
> George, Fleur, Devon, Casey, Marigold, Apple Mint

---

## 🚧 Planned Enhancements

- [ ] Save and retrieve chicken records using CSV or text files  
- [ ] Add validation and error handling  
- [ ] Improve user experience and interface flow  
- [ ] Possibly refactor to use classes or a more modular design
