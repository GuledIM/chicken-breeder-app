# 🐔 Chicken Records CLI Application

## Project Overview

A **work-in-progress PoC** CLI app for a local Chicken Breeder to digitize their paper records into a simple database.

Over 4 weeks, it will evolve from an in-memory list to support file storage and more features.

## Project Objective

Build a CLI with a menu to:

```

0 - Exit App
1 - Print Chicken Records
2 - Create New Record
3 - Update Record
4 - Delete Record

````

## Current Functionality (Week 1–2)

- [x] Print to screen  
- [ ] Clear the screen  
- [x] Accept user input  
- [x] Store chicken names in a Python list  

> Example names: George, Fleur, Devon, Casey, Marigold, Apple Mint

## Planned Enhancements
