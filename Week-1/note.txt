Initial commit with hardcoded CLI menu and basic CRUD functions for managing chickens:

- Implemented print (list), add, update, and delete functions for chickens.
- Menu is currently hardcoded with input prompts and simple logic.
- Next steps:
  * Add automated testing with pytest and input/output mocking.
  * Add input validation to improve robustness.
  * Refactor code to use Classes and OOP principles for scalability and maintainability.
